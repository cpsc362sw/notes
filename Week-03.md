# Process

## Activities
- Same activity will vary depending on size of project
  - Ex: Casual phone call with individual vs. formal conference call for requirements

## Tasks
- Notes
- Milestones

## Framework Activity
- idk my bff jill

## Process Flow
- Describes how the framework activities, actions and tasks that occur within each framework activity are organizing with respect to sequence and time
- A __linear__ process flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence beginning with communication
- An __iterative__ process flow repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to the next
- An __evolutionary__ process flow executes the activities in a circular manner. Each circuit through the five activities leads to a more complete version of the software
- A __parallel__ process flow executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities
- Flow of choice is a matter of personal preference although iterative and evolutionary allow for easier change

## Communication Example

### Small/simple project
1. Make a list of stakeholders for the project
2. Invite all stakeholders to an informal meeting
3. Ask each stakeholder to make a list of the features and functions required
4. Discuss the requirements and build the final list
5. Prioritize requirements
6. Note areas of uncertainty

### Large/complex project
1. Make a list of stakeholders
2. Interview each stakeholder separately to determine overall wants and needs
3. Build preliminary list of functions and features based on their input
4. Schedule a series of facilitated application-specific meetings
5. Conduct meeting
6. Produce informal user scenarios as part of each meeting
7. Refine user scenarios based on stakeholder feedback
8. Build a reused list of requirements
9. Use quality function deployment techniques to prioritize requirements
10. Package requirements so they can be delivered incrementally
11. Note the constraints and possible obstacles
12. Discuss methods for validation

## Six distinct actions
1. Inception
2. Elicitation
3. Elaboration
4. Negotiation
5. Specification
6. Validation

## Pattern
The same broad features keep recurring over and over again, although in their detailed appearance these broad featured are never the same. Three different types: stage, task, and phase.
