# Prescriptive Models
	- process models advocate an orderly approach to software engineering
	- originally proposed to bring order to the chaos of SofDev
	- prescribe a distinct set of activites, actions, tasks, milestones & work product
	- adapted to meet the need of software engineers & managers for a specific project
	- provide stability, control, and organiation, to a process that if not managed can easily get out of control
	- framework activites for a particular process model may be organized into a process flow that may be linear, incremental, and evolutionary.

# WaterFall Model
	- Communication
		- project initiation requirement gathering
	- Planning
		- estimating, scheduling, tracking
	- Modeling
		- analysis, design
	- Construction
		- code, test
	- Deployment
		- delivery, support, feedback

	- best indicators of how well a SW process has worked are:
		- quality
		- timelines
		- long-term viability

	- requirement well understood
	- well defined adaptaion to an existing system must be made
	- variation (V-model)

* Problems in waterfall
	- sequentially flow rarely followed (change may cause confusion)
	- hard for customer to request explicity
	- customer must have patience, nothing to show until the end of the process
	- blocking state: some team members must wait for the other to complete dependent tasks
		- time spent waiting is more than production time
	- not good for todays never ending stream of change

# Incremental Model
	- requirements are reasonably understood
	- but overall scope of the development is linear
	- need for limited set of software functionality
	- then refine and expand in later releases
	- combine linear and parallel flow
	- core product -> base requirements but not supplemntary featuers -> customer use
		-> evaluation -> plan for next increment -> modification of core product and additional features

# Evolutionary Process Model
	- iterative
	- set of core product or system requirements are well understood
		- but details of product or system extensions have yet to be defined
	- grow and change
	- prototyping
		- for when details are fuzzy
		- customer defines a set of general objectives but does not identify details
	- serves as a mechanism for identifying software requirements
	- communication -> meet stakeholders -> know requirements -> prototyping iteration is planned
		-> modeling occurs -> quick design for aspects of sw that are visible
		-> construction of prototype -> deployed and evaluation

# Evolution Models - The Spiral
	- combination of iterative prototyping & systematic aspect of waterfall
	- rapid dev & more complete version
	- early iteration: the release might be a model or prototype
	- later: more complete version of the product
	- each of the activities represent one segment of the spiral path
	- one circuit around the spiral might result in the dev of a product specifcation
	- uses prototyping as a risk reduction
