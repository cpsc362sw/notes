# The Unified Process

##Componenet based development
* leads to software reuse
* reduce cycle time and project cost
* commerical off the shelf software compnents developed by vendrs who offer them as product, provide targeted functionality.
	1. Available component based product are researched and evalulated.
	2. Component integration issues are considered.
	3. Architecture is designed to accomodate the component.
	4. Components are integrated into the architecture.
	5. Testing is aconducted to ensure proper functionality.

## UP
* Use case driven, architecture-centric, iterative and incremental
* Recognizes the importance of customer communications and descrives customer view of the system ( use case )
* Phases of UP
	1. Inception:
		- by collaboration with stakeholders, business requirement for the software
		- plan for iterative, incremental is developed.
	2. Elaboration
		- planning and modeling activites
		- refine use cases
		- create executable architectual baseline
	3. Construction
		- Analysis and design models that were started during elaboration are complete.
		- Necessary functions and features are implemented in source.
		- Conduct unit test and QA
	4. Transition
		- Last step of construction and first for depoloyment ( delivery and feedback )
		- user use the software
		- user manuals, troubleshooting guides, installation procedures
		- software increment becomes usable
	5. Production
		- use of the software monitored 
		- detect reports
		- request for changes are submitted
