## Links
> I highly recommend taking a look at [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [PHP for Beginners](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners) first.  There are courses on PHP, HTML, CSS etc.  It's a good all around utility to get your foot in the door.  If you get confused you can always look things up at [PHP.net](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php) or [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/php/).  Laravel is an MVC framework, for a dive into what MVC is you can look at [PHP MVC-Pattern](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/).  Lastly, if you have gotten this far and are truely masochistic here's some [awesome vidoes](https://laracasts.com) and [documentation](https://laravel.com) about Laravel specifically.
